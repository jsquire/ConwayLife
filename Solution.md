# Conway's Game of Life Challenge

### Solutions overview

The full signed 64-bit coordinate space is too large to store or process as a grid.  Even a rectangle around a small starting population can contain an enormous amount of empty space.  These constraints apply regardless of the approach used to simulate the population.

Any solution must identify the cells that need consideration while keeping each generation based on the completed state of the previous one.  It must also handle coordinates at the signed 64-bit limits without allowing arithmetic to wrap across the board.  How the population is represented and how repeated work is avoided determine much of the cost, with trade-offs between execution time, memory use, and implementation complexity.

### The initial approach

In the spirit of the exercise, this approach was conceptualized by exploring the problem space and approaching it intuitively as a candidate would do in a whiteboard setting.  No research into prior art, common algorithms, nor the work of others was done.

The approach used was to implement the intuitive solution in modern C# with attention to performance considerations, specifically focusing on avoiding allocations and efficient reuse of sets.  A deliberate effort was made to optimize for readability over raw performance where techniques such as bit-shifting would have made the code less clear without a demonstrated performance benefit.

The simulation strategy is hand-written with no AI coding assistance.  AI was used in the exploration of the problem space, analysis, synthesizing a comprehensive test matrix, implementing the test suite, and boilerplate infrastructure code.  All AI code was reviewed for safety and correctness and tweaked by hand to ensure consistency with the surrounding codebase.

**_Concept_**

A surviving cell must already be alive.  A birth must be next to live cells.  Together, these observations limit each generation's decisions to the starting live cells and their dead neighbors.

A `HashSet<Coordinate>` stores the population for live-neighbor lookups.  A separate set collects the next population so that births and deaths do not affect the current generation's decisions, as the rules require that the generation is processed as a pure function.  Dead candidates with no state change are tracked separately to avoid reevaluating them during the generation.

Coordinates remain pairs of signed 64-bit integers.  Neighbor offsets are checked before addition, excluding positions outside the coordinate range rather than allowing them to wrap.  Unlike the ideal infinite board, this board has edges and corners.

**_Steps_**

1. If no generations are requested, the state does not change.  The result is a copy of the starting population.

2. For each generation, keep the starting population unchanged while collecting the next population and tracking evaluated dead candidates.

3. Visit each live cell and its initially dead neighbors.  Count each cell's live neighbors using only the starting population.

4. Add surviving cells and new births to the next population.  Record initially dead candidates that remain dead in the visited set.  A candidate already present in either set does not need to be evaluated again during the generation.

5. Return the result when the requested generations are complete.  Otherwise, exchange the population sets and clear the working sets for reuse.  Stop early if the population becomes empty.

**_Example_**

Consider three live cells in a horizontal line, commonly called a blinker.

| Generation | Live coordinates |
| --- | --- |
| Starting population | `(0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1)` |
| Next population | `(1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2)` |

1. The two end cells each have one live neighbor and die.

2. The middle cell has two live neighbors and survives.

3. The dead cells above and below the middle each have three live neighbors and become alive.

Both birth locations are reached from multiple starting cells, but their outcomes are calculated only once.  The births are collected separately and do not contribute to neighbor counts until the next generation.

**_Complexity_**

Let `n` be the largest live population reached during the simulation, including the starting population, and `g` the number of generations actually executed.

Expected time complexity is `O(g * n)` for a nonempty simulation, assuming expected constant-time hash lookups and amortized constant-time insertion.  Each starting live cell has at most eight neighbors, and each distinct candidate examines at most eight neighbors of its own.  The nested loops and bounded recursion therefore do not add another population-sized factor.

Using the largest population also accounts for clearing reused sets, whose retained capacity can exceed the current population.  Heavy hash collisions can make lookups linear, giving a conservative worst-case bound of `O(g * n^2)`.

Space complexity is `O(n)` for the population sets and visited candidates.  Recursion depth is bounded independently of population size.  With zero generations, copying the input takes `O(n)` time and space.

**_Practical Performance_**

Coordinates are value types, and neighbor enumeration does not allocate temporary collections.  The population buffers are reused rather than recreated for each generation.  A single-generation run reads the caller's input directly.  Longer runs copy it once to keep buffer reuse from modifying that input.

Population growth increases both the work and storage required.  The working sets retain their capacity when cleared, so a small final population does not imply a small memory footprint throughout the run.

The processing rate and memory allowance in the [problem-space discussion](./ReadMe.md#problem-space) are planning estimates.  They are not measured throughput or peak-memory results for this implementation.

### Other approaches

Hashlife is a more advanced algorithm used by modern programs such as Golly.  It represents patterns as a tree structure, which allows it to simulate very large patterns efficiently.  It is a candidate for the efficiency iteration.
